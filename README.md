# Server Installation Guide

## Overview

This project is a backend server built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It includes features like authentication, email sending, file uploads, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v16 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node package manager)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) or a MongoDB Atlas account

## Installation Steps

Follow the steps below to set up the project on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository from GitHub using the following command:

```bash
(https://github.com/SalluMia/taskproject_server.git)
cd client
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary packages, including:

- `bcryptjs`
- `cors`
- `dotenv`
- `express`
- `express-mongo-sanitize`
- `express-rate-limit`
- `express-validator`
- `helmet`
- `joi`
- `jsonwebtoken`
- `mongoose`
- `morgan`
- `multer`
- `nodemailer`
- `nodemon`
- `xss-clean`

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory and add the following environment variables:

```
PORT=your-port
MONGO_URI=your-mongo-db-uri
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
EMAIL_USER=your-email-address
EMAIL_PASS=your-email-password
```

- **PORT**: The port on which the server will run.
- **MONGO_URI**: The connection string for your MongoDB database.
- **JWT_SECRET**: A secret key used to sign JWT tokens (can be any random string).
- **EMAIL_USER** and **EMAIL_PASS**: The email credentials for sending email using Nodemailer (ensure to use an email provider that supports Nodemailer, like Gmail).

### 4. Start the Server

To start the server, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will use `nodemon` to start the server in development mode, and it will automatically restart when you make changes.

### 5. Access the Server

Once the server is running, it will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Available Scripts

- `npm start` – Starts the server using `nodemon`.
- `npm run test` – Currently a placeholder, run tests when they are implemented.
